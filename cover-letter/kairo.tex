My name is Anthony Walker and I am a fourth year PhD student at Oregon State University and I am interested in the computational science internship at Kairos Power. 
I am qualified for these positions because I have a wide breadth of experience in many subjects. 
Nominally, my degree is in mechanical engineering but my work is a combination of computer science, software development, physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc. 
I also have substantial course work and minors in computer science.

I have experience in both teaching and research. 
I have served as a teaching assistant for multiple classes in the mechanical engineering department and I am currently teaching a "Computer Programming for Mechanical Systems" course at Oregon State University. 
My research requires that I implement new functionality in an open-source chemical kinetics package called Cantera. 
My day to day requires the use of C++, Python, and Bash to develop, implement, and test numerical techniques as well as apply them to physical problems. 

Similarly, my Master's project required the implementation of techniques to accelerate simulations of
multi-physics problems in multiple dimensions. 
These techniques were specifically designed to avoid latency expense on a combination of CPUs and GPUs on distributed computing systems. 
All of the code to implement and study these techniques was developed from scratch by me and is openly available on my github.

In conclusion, I have a diverse skill set that aligns well with the computational science internship. I have worked in collaboration with others on real and practical open-source software used to model chemistry and fire. 
Finally, I am an avid learner and any of the skills that I do not already have can be efficiently developed to meet the needs of the project that I am working on.
